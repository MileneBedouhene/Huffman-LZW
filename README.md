# Huffman & LZW Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of **Huffman** and **LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch)** compression and decompression algorithms. The implementations are provided in **Python** with examples demonstrating their usage.

## Algorithms Overview

### Huffman Algorithm
- A lossless compression method that uses variable-length encoding based on character frequencies.
- Includes both compression and decompression implementations.

### LZW Algorithm
- A dictionary-based compression method commonly used in formats like GIF.
- Includes both compression and decompression implementations.
